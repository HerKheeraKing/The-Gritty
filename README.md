# The-Gritty
"The Gritty" is a thrilling first-person dungeon crawler set in a dreary underground world, where players combat legions of enemies, defeat formidable bosses, and find mystical potions. Players experience a unique class system, choosing from a fire-wielding mage, a strong melee-focused warrior, or a cunning archer to face a variety of foes, including acid-spitting spider bosses and highly skilled black knights. Navigate through a labyrinthine maze filled with treacherous twists and hidden dangers!‚Äù
